Submitted by Benjamin Mullins
## How to Install and Run
1. Download the solution `.zip` file or clone the repository to your local machine
2. Using the IDE of your choice (I used NetBeans), open the project
3. Build and run the project
4. Open up a web browser of your choice and go to `localhost:4567/<ENTER AN ID>/<ENTER A MESSAGE>`
5. Where it says `<ENTER AN ID>` and `<ENTER A MESSAGE>` enter an arbitrary message id and a message
6. The output should display a JSON document with the correct total count of words in all the messages entered while ignoring previously entered ids
